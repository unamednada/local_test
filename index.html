          <h4>Creativity</h4>
          <p>
            Since my ealry childhood - the golden times of playdough and Legos -
            I have had a creative way of thinking. From beautiful desgining to
            quick problem-solving, I have been working to improve even further
            this so innate trait.

          <h4>Persuasion & Adaptability</h4>
          <p>
            When travelling around Europe and Asia and residing in a couple of
            different countries, I have learned that I can adapt to challenging
            situations in order to meet a goal. I have also learned the
            importance of persuation in such occasions, and since then I have
            worked to develop this soft skill.

          <h4>Collaboration & Emotional Inteligence</h4>
          <p>
            As both a group leader and part of a team, I have had a fair share
            of positive experience regarding working as a team. Being listening
            and being helpful or taking action and being a leader, mastering my
            own feelings has played a huge role on my success so far.

            I am a pretty open person and I'd love to hear what you think about

          <p>
            I am currently also open for an internship or freelance work.
            Although I'd love to get into the market right now, I must finish my
            course at <a href="https://www.betrybe.com/">Trybe</a> before
            actually start actively looking for a more permanent position. But
            feel free to hang aroung and contact me for any opportunity you may
            find suitable.

          <h4>Hobbies and early professional life</h4>
          <p>
            Besides my passion for coding and my facility to work with numbers,
            I have always had a thing for words. I like writing poetry, but for
            now only for close ones... I have once spoken six languages fluenty,
            it's sad that now I'm down to only four, being Portuguese, English,
            Spanish and Russian.
          </p>
          <p>
            So this "thing" of mine with words led me to teaching about 10 years
            ago, and since then I have grown to be a recently Cambridge CELTA
            Certified teacher and a Cambridge's CPE C2 Speaker. This has
            definitely helped me with my studies.
